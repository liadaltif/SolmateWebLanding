      <h1>Solmate Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Hey there! Welcome to Solmate&apos;s Privacy Policy. We know reading a
        privacy policy might not be everyone&apos;s idea of a good time, but
        we&apos;ve tried to keep this as clear and straightforward as possible.
        Think of us as your musical wingmate, here to explain what data we
        collect, why we collect it, and how we use and protect it.
      </p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy applies from August 15, 2025.</p>

      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Solmate is a dating application owned and operated by Liad Altif. We are
        the &quot;data controller&quot; responsible for your personal
        information under applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to our website, mobile application, and any
        other online products or services we operate under the Solmate brand
        (together, the &quot;service&quot;). If any part of the service has its
        own separate privacy policy, that specific policy will apply instead of
        this one for that service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        To help you find meaningful connections through music, we need to
        process some information about you. We collect:
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Information you give us</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account data:</strong> When you create an account, you provide
          information such as your name, location, email address, date of birth,
          gender, sexual preference and access to your music streaming accounts
          (Apple Music and/or Spotify).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile and preference data:</strong> Information you add to
          your profile and your preferences for the types of people you&apos;d
          like to meet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchase data:</strong> When you make a purchase, we keep
          details of the transaction (for example what you purchased, the date
          and the price). The exact data depends on the payment method you use.
          When you pay directly with us, you provide your debit or credit card
          number or other financial information to our payment provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer support data:</strong> When you contact us, we
          receive the information you choose to share and anything necessary to
          help address your inquiry. We may also receive reports or complaints
          about you from other people, and our moderation tools may generate
          additional data in the course of their investigations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Information generated when you use the service</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage data:</strong> Information about how you use the
          service, such as when you logged in, features you&apos;ve used,
          actions you&apos;ve taken (for example searching, matching and
          messaging), and the content shown to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical data:</strong> Information about the device(s) and
          software you use to access the service, such as IP address, device ID
          and type, app settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising
          IDs and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that
          may uniquely identify a device or browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Music listening data:</strong> If you connect your music
          streaming account, and give us permission, we receive information
          about your musical taste and listening habits from those services to
          help us improve our matching.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Information we collect with your permission</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Geolocation data:</strong> If you allow it in your device
          settings, we collect your precise location (latitude and longitude)
          from your device. If you decline, features that rely on precise
          location may not be available.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
      <p>We use your data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide and operate the service:</strong> Create and maintain
          your account and profile, operate app features, connect you with
          members who share your musical taste, recommend you to others, handle
          your requests and questions, and monitor and improve how the service
          works.
        </li>
        <li>

          and promotions and, where relevant, customize prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improve Solmate:</strong> Analyze how the service is used,
          improve existing features, and develop new features and services,
          including our music matching algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marketing:</strong> Run and measure marketing and advertising
          campaigns promoting our own service on third-party platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety and integrity:</strong> Prevent, detect and fight
          against violations of our Terms, fraud and other illegal or
          unauthorized activities; develop and improve tools for moderation and
          fraud prevention; prevent recurrences (for example by preventing
          banned individuals from creating new accounts); inform reporters what
          action we took on their reports; verify your identity; and secure
          payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and compliance:</strong> Comply with applicable law,
          preserve data as required by Israeli law, respond to lawful requests
          from courts, regulators and law enforcement, support investigations,
          and establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Under Israeli law (including the Protection of Privacy Law, 1981 and the
        Privacy Protection (Data Security) Regulations, 2017), we process your
        personal data based on one or more of the following legal grounds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</li>
        <li>Performance of our contract with you (providing the service).</li>
        <li>
          Our legitimate interests, where they do not override your fundamental
          rights and freedoms (for example ensuring safety and improving the
          service).
        </li>
        <li>Compliance with legal obligations under Israeli law.</li>
        <li>
          Protection of your vital interests or those of another person (for
          example, in cases involving safety of individuals).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. How We Share Data</h2>
      <p>We share your data in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>With other members:</strong> Information you choose to make
          public on your profile, including your music preferences, is visible
          to other members. If someone submits a report involving you, we may
          let them know what action we took (if any).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With service providers and partners:</strong> We use trusted
          third parties to help us operate, promote and improve the service, for
          example for data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care,
          marketing and advertising, payment processing, legal support and
          security operations. These partners only receive the data they need
          for their work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With law enforcement and authorities:</strong> We may disclose
          data to comply with legal processes under Israeli law (such as court
          orders, subpoenas, search warrants or investigations), to assist in
          preventing or detecting crime, to protect the safety of any person, or
          to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transfers:</strong> If Solmate is involved in a
          merger, acquisition, sale, restructuring or similar transaction, your
          data may be transferred as part of that deal, subject to appropriate
          safeguards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Because we operate a global service, your data may be transferred to and
        processed in countries outside Israel, which may have different data
        protection laws. When we transfer personal data to a country that has
        not been recognized by the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority as
        providing an adequate level of protection, we use appropriate
        safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or similar
        arrangements, to help protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to Israeli law, you have the following rights regarding your
        personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Access:</strong> The right to be informed of the personal data
          we process about you and/or request a copy of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rectification:</strong> The right to amend or update your
          personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update
          much of your data directly in the app by editing your profile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion:</strong> The right to request deletion of your
          personal data. You can delete certain data in the app and you can also
          close your account; we then handle your data as described in the
          retention section below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection and restriction:</strong> The right to object to our
          processing of your data or to request that we temporarily or
          permanently stop certain processing. You can, for example, opt out of
          certain processing in your account settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Withdrawal of consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent,
          you can withdraw it at any time by updating your account settings or
          your device permissions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For your protection and the protection of other members, we may ask you
        to verify your identity before we act on your request.
      </p>

      <h2>9. How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate
        business purposes and as permitted by Israeli law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you stop using Solmate, you can close your account and your profile
        will no longer be visible to other members. We may also close your
        account automatically if you are inactive for two years.
      </p>
      <p>After account closure, we generally handle your data as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We keep most data for a short safety period (for example around three
          months after you close your account, or around one year after an
          account ban) to investigate unlawful or harmful conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          We keep some data to comply with legal obligations, such as
          transaction data for tax and accounting purposes (often up to seven
          years) and logs for periods required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          We keep some data on the basis of our legitimate interests, such as
          customer care records, information needed to prevent banned users from
          creating new accounts, and basic account history, for periods
          consistent with Israeli law.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may keep data longer where there is an ongoing or potential dispute
          or legal request (for example if we receive a valid subpoena or order
          requiring us to preserve data).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Solmate is intended only for users who are 18 years of age or older. We
        do not knowingly permit individuals under 18 on our platform. If you
        believe someone under 18 is using the service, please use the reporting
        tools in the app or contact us using the details below.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make
        material changes, we will let you know in an appropriate way (for
        example by showing a notice in the app or sending you an email) so that
        you have the chance to review the updated policy before it takes
        effect.
      </p>
